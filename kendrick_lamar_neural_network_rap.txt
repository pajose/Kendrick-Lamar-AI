Some say it's only one that thirst for necessity
This shit was meant to be the messiah of society
Jason keaton, i can fuck it i got no money
Why you maney-ass rap niggas looking funny
Not a rap on how we just pray we keep on philly
Its 2004 and i'm back chilling with two hoes in here say
I live forever baby, count it all go away
Livin life in a stadium, pack it the legal way
We apologize if you never let it, go
When you walked inside your desire to blow
A louis belt will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Ali recorded and i'm back in proper context
We could never rewrite history in a minute
I done been through a straw, fuck a pit-stop or what not
At 3:14, it's time to be a typical homy
Go at a stranger like i can't even keep the rest
But homie you made me an engine that go real fast
I don't know if you need to be lonely
We all seem to separate, eventually
I made an oath when my mental telepathy
I made an oath when my life's entirely
Hundred hoes, hundred fold, this my third felony
On behalf of the world on my grind, all ready
Poppa flicking blunt ashes all on a thursday
And i stand by her, she be like them grown ups hey
